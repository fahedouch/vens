# Context hints for OWASP Risk Rating
# These hints help the LLM calculate accurate risk scores for each vulnerability
# Reference: https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology

context:
  # === EXPOSURE ===
  # How is the system exposed to potential attackers?
  # Values: internal | private | internet
  #   - internal: Corporate network only, no external access
  #   - private: Requires VPN or authentication to access
  #   - internet: Publicly accessible from the internet
  exposure: "internet"

  # === DATA SENSITIVITY ===
  # What type of data does the system handle?
  # Values: low | medium | high | critical
  #   - low: Public data, no confidentiality requirements
  #   - medium: Internal data, limited confidentiality
  #   - high: PII, financial data, customer information
  #   - critical: Secrets, credentials, PHI, payment card data
  data_sensitivity: "high"

  # === BUSINESS CRITICALITY ===
  # How critical is this system for business operations?
  # Values: low | medium | high | critical
  #   - low: Development/test environments
  #   - medium: Internal tools, non-essential services
  #   - high: Customer-facing services, important operations
  #   - critical: Revenue-critical, compliance-required, core business
  business_criticality: "critical"

  # === AVAILABILITY REQUIREMENT (optional) ===
  # How critical is system availability? Affects DoS/Availability vulnerability scores.
  # Values: low | medium | high | critical
  # Default: Inherits from business_criticality if not specified
  # Uncomment and set explicitly if availability requirements differ from business criticality
  # availability_requirement: "critical"

  # === COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS (optional) ===
  # List of regulatory/compliance frameworks that apply to this system.
  # Used to increase business impact scores for compliance-related vulnerabilities.
  # Supported frameworks: PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, ISO27001, FISMA, FedRAMP
  # Default: Empty (no compliance requirements)
  # Uncomment and specify if compliance frameworks apply
  # compliance_requirements:
  #   - "PCI-DSS"
  #   - "GDPR"

  # === AUDIT REQUIREMENT (optional) ===
  # How critical are audit logs and accountability? Affects accountability vulnerability scores.
  # Values: low | medium | high
  # Default: "low" if not specified
  # Uncomment and set if audit/accountability is critical (e.g., financial systems)
  # audit_requirement: "high"

  # === SECURITY CONTROLS (optional) ===
  # Specify which security controls are in place. These reduce vulnerability scores
  # by making attacks harder to discover and exploit.
  # All controls default to false (not present) if not specified.
  # controls:
  #   # Perimeter controls
  #   waf: true                    # Web Application Firewall (blocks common attacks)
  #   ddos_protection: false       # DDoS mitigation service
  #
  #   # Detection controls
  #   ids: false                   # Intrusion Detection System
  #   siem: false                  # Security Information & Event Management
  #
  #   # Endpoint controls
  #   edr: false                   # Endpoint Detection & Response
  #   antivirus: false             # Antivirus/Anti-malware
  #
  #   # Network controls
  #   segmentation: false          # Network micro-segmentation
  #   zero_trust: false            # Zero-trust architecture

  # === ADDITIONAL NOTES (optional) ===
  # Free-form text to provide extra context for the LLM
  # Examples: compliance requirements, specific threats, architecture details
